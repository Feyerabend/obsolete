# Obsolete source files in Java

Most of these files were made around 1998-2001 and reflect the Java of that time.
They were intended for a follow-up book, which never was. But today it is more of
an example for instructional use and illustrates Java simply enough, and how one
might look at data structures. It was also before generics were implemented and
standardized in Java, when experimental compilers were out.
