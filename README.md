# Obsolete source files in Java

Most of these files were made in ca 1998-2001, and reflects the Java of that time. They were intended for a follow up book,
that never was. But today it is more of samples for instructional use and illustrates simple enough Java, and
how one could look at data structures. It was also before generics were implemented and standardized in Java,
when experimental compilers were out.

Some files published in the Swedish computer magazine DMZ ('Datormagazin').
