# Obsolete Java source files and some introductory texts

Most of these files were made around 1998 until maybe 2001 or so, and reflect Java
of that time. They were intended for a follow-up to a book published in 1997, but
that never was. Today it is more of an example for instructional use and illustrates
Java simply enough at that time. It was also before e.g. generics were implemented,
when they still were experimental.

## Documents

### [Introduction](INTRO.md)

It starts with a synopsis of the planned book, or an introduction to Java. Just to get
things started.


### [Object-Orientation](OBJECT.md)

A chapter on object orientation in Java. It outlines the traditional way of OO when
describing a programming language. In short, what the language can do and is intended
to do.


### [Data Structures](STRUCT.md)

Some files published in the Swedish computer magazine DMZ ('Datormagazin').
The archive does not seems to be coherent, and lacking files.
