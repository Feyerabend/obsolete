# Obsolete Java source files and some introductory texts

Most of these files were made around 1998 until maybe 2001 or so, and reflect Java
of that time. They were intended for a follow-up to a book published in 1997, but
that never was. Today it is more of an example for instructional use and illustrates
Java simply enough at that time. It was also before e.g. generics were implemented,
when they still were experimental.

Some files published in the Swedish computer magazine DMZ ('Datormagazin').
Seems to be lacking some files though.
